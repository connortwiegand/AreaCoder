# AreaCoder
AreaCoder is a R-driven project designed to pull phone number area codes from the internet and match them with level-1 administration data for the geospatial visualization of area codes, leaving open the possibility of future analysis

## Possible Stages of this Project

1. Pulling select area codes and level 1 admin data, generating maps as these resources change
2. Combine this data into it's own novel dataset, or provide a more sophisticated collection of programs which are capable of automatically reading the data for any country on-the-fly (option to bundle said data or programs to remain open).
3. Provide related analyses, with a range of interpretting whether the area codes are organized in a particular manner, to providing related visulizations such as postal-codes, but not limited to more interesting and informative inferences and summarizations. 

## Motivation and Uses
If nothing else, this project showcases skills and interest in data science, particularly through the chanels of web-scrapping and data visualization. This porject began as a way of gaining a competitive edge in a popular web-based geography game using my computer science background. It's uses may be limited to personal data visulization and database completeness, but may serve the interest of professionals or myself in some further capacity.
